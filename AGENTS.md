# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# Git workflow

- Commit messages use Conventional Commits with a mandatory scope: `type(scope): description`. Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, build, ci. Scope names the part of the codebase affected (e.g. `frontend`, `db`, `auth`, `messages`, `ci`). Add an optional body (blank line after the subject) when the change needs context — what and why, not how. Example: `fix(messages): scroll thread to newest message on load`.
- Do not commit directly to `main`. Work on a feature branch named `type/short-description` (e.g. `feat/photo-cleanup`, `fix/rls-conversation-owner`), branched from an up-to-date `main`.
- Open a pull request into `main` for every change; the PR description states what changed and how it was verified. Keep PRs focused on one concern.
